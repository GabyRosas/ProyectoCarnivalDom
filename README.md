***

1. **How can I create a branch?**
   Branches allow us to work on our project without touching the main code.
   To create a branch, run:

   **git branch branch-name**

   To switch to that branch:

   **git checkout branch-name**

   To merge all the changes from that specific branch to the main branch:
   First, switch to the main branch:

   **git checkout main**

   And now merge the branches, specifying which branch you want to merge:

   **git merge branch-name**

   You can also merge to other branches besides the main one. To do this, instead of using `git checkout main`, switch to the desired branch and then execute the merge.
